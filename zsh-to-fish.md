When switching from `zsh` to `fish`, your environment configurations (like paths for Flutter, `pnpm`, and other commands) may not automatically carry over. 
Hereâ€™s how to resolve this and get your commands working in `fish`:

---

### **1. Understand the Issue**
- `fish` uses its own configuration file (`~/.config/fish/config.fish`) and doesn't directly read `zsh` configurations like `.zshrc` or `.zshenv`.
- Commands like `flutter` and `pnpm` may not work because their binaries are not in `fish`'s `$PATH`.

---

### **2. Check Your Current PATH**
Run the following command in `fish` to see your current PATH:
```fish
echo $PATH
```
If the directories for Flutter, `pnpm`, or other tools are missing, you need to add them.

---

### **3. Locate Missing Binaries**
To find the paths for `flutter` or `pnpm`, you can switch back to `zsh` and run:
```bash
which flutter
which pnpm
```
Note the output paths (e.g., `/opt/homebrew/bin/flutter` or `/usr/local/bin/pnpm`).

---

### **4. Add Paths to fish Configuration**
Edit your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` file to include the missing paths:
```fish
nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Add lines like this:
```fish
set -gx PATH /path/to/flutter/bin /path/to/pnpm $PATH
```
For example, if `flutter` is in `/opt/homebrew/bin`:
```fish
set -gx PATH /opt/homebrew/bin $PATH
```

Save and exit the editor, then reload your `fish` configuration:
```fish
source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

---

### **5. Reinstall Missing Tools in fish**
If you used tools like `nvm`, `asdf`, or `pnpm`, they might need to be reinitialized in `fish`.

#### **a. Flutter**
Add Flutter to your PATH as shown above, or reinstall Flutter if necessary:
```fish
set -gx PATH $HOME/flutter/bin $PATH
flutter doctor
```

#### **b. pnpm**
If installed via Homebrew:
```fish
set -gx PATH /opt/homebrew/bin $PATH
```
Or install it again:
```fish
brew install pnpm
```

#### **c. Node Version Managers (nvm/asdf)**
If you used `nvm` or `asdf`:
- Install the `fish` plugin for `asdf`:
  ```fish
  asdf plugin-add nodejs
  asdf reshim nodejs
  ```
- For `nvm`, use a `fish`-compatible version like `fnm`:
  ```fish
  brew install fnm
  fnm install 16  # Example for Node.js 16
  fnm use 16
  ```

---

### **6. Verify the Commands**
After updating the configuration, verify the commands:
```fish
flutter --version
pnpm --version
```

---

### **7. Optional: Use `oh-my-fish`**
If you liked `oh-my-zsh`, consider using `oh-my-fish` for similar functionality:
```fish
curl -L https://get.oh-my.fish | fish
```

---

### **8. Switching Back to zsh (if Needed)**
If you want to temporarily switch back to `zsh`:
```fish
exec zsh
```

Or make `zsh` the default again:
```zsh
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```
